# Lyrics Generator using LSTM 

Here I've trained a LSTM network to work as a language model on lyrics of a specific singer(in this case Taylor Swift) and then tried to genrate new lyrics.

Some Sample Lyrics generated by model

It has started to lose context just after some words. Model architecture is kept simple for learning purpose. Better Architecture can be tried , or more lyrics can be added to corpus for better generation.

After LSTMs, Transformers have evolved to be better state-of-art models for many tasks as they make use of attention efficiently and also be trained in parallel unlike RNNs which depened on backpropgation in sequence.
